## Closing of Google Code ##
You can download zip files with source and binary code and learning materials from
my web site: [software tools](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari/software/index.html)
and [files associated with textbooks](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari/books/index.html).

If you wish to initiate a collaborative development, the projects are also available as repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/motib?tab=repositories).

## Overview ##
SyntaxTrain is a tool which reads and verifies a source file using a given BNF file and graphically shows the error using Syntax Diagrams.
